### 💬 How to Handle Merge Conflicts

Merge conflicts are a common part of collaboration in open source. They occur when multiple people make changes to the same lines of code in a file or when one contributor edits a file that another contributor has deleted. Understanding why they happen helps us approach conflicts with care and respect for others’ contributions.

#### 🖥️ Steps to Resolve Merge Conflicts:
1. **Identify the conflicting files** in your branch.
2. **Open the files** and locate the conflict markers:
   - `<<<<<<<` marks the beginning of your changes.
   - `=======` separates your changes from others' changes.
   - `>>>>>>>` marks the end of the conflicting code.
3. **Decide which changes to keep**, either by integrating both sets of changes or choosing one. Then, remove the conflict markers to clean up the file.
4. **Save the file**, add it to the staging area, and commit your changes.

> **Note**: When resolving a conflict, make sure not to delete other contributors’ code without reviewing it. Try to combine changes where possible to preserve everyone’s contributions.
